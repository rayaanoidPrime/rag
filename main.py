        # For ThreadPoolExecutor, if it's session-scoped via @st.cache_resource,

        # or the app server stops. For a ThreadPoolExecutor, a more explicit shutdown
        # as part of the application's teardown process is good practice if possible.
        # For now, let's assume this `finally` block in `main` will be reached
        # when the script exits (e.g., if Streamlit server is stopped).
        # A more robust solution for web apps might involve `atexit` module or framework signals.

    # If orchestrator were a global singleton not managed by Streamlit's cache,

    # But with @st.cache_resource, the lifecycle is tied to Streamlit's caching.
    # Python's `atexit` module is a more reliable way to ensure cleanup on script exit.
